    Today marks the start of this journal. I plan to mostly focus on coding practices/tips I find myself learning overtime.
    Like how python pip requires a virtual environment, so installing it on the hardware is just a waste ngl.

    Just found out that we need to keep this journal up every week. I want to smash my brains out of pure agony. I just missed like 2 months of entries, I'm super screwed. We talk about this once, and forget it. Like. Dude. I wanna cry dude. Like I wanna piss all over assignments and burn them in a dumpster. So many god damn projects I need to trackkkkkkkkk. I just added a weekly assignment to canvas, cause yeah. I aint remembering to open VSCODE for anything EXCEPT CANVAS. NOT ESPECIALLY A JOURNAL IN .MD (I USE OBSIDIAN FOR MY MD FILES)

    I got my midterm today. I didn't study for it last night, so I only have the hour before class to study. It scares me a bit, just because I REALLY want a good grade. I don't think I'll get one, but I need to study very hard before the class anyways. I was doing the homework last night, and it was extremely maddening how fast the questions devolved into uncomprehensible answers that use techniques that are impossible to understand.

    Missed a week ugggghhh. I had the most horrible two shifts ever this weekend, but now im past it, so I shouldn't worry bout it. I need money. I'm mostly caught up now, just need to work on my web design class projects, which are like 1-2 weeks overdue now. shoot. If I do a journal sunday can that count for this week instead of this one?

    Told you I'd be back. I feel a lot better about myself now. I know that the outlook is really bleak, but now that I have money issues off my back, I'm ready to face school head on. I've been putting off assignments wayy too much this semester, and this past week I've started doing at least *part* of an assignment every day. At least a substantial chunk. With work, I really can't rely on smooth coasting with last minute work, and a lot of assignments I need to track myself. So time to pull my bootstraps or something.

    Happy Halloween I guess. I dressed as a clown this year, it was alright. I gotta work on a math project today, if I don't do it my grade is probably a definite F for the semester. I gotta work more on my team project this week, I've barely touched the repo. I got a new watch after my birthday last month, but I regret it now. I could've spent those dollars on food and tuiton. I don't need another watch.
