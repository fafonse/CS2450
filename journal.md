    Today marks the start of this journal. I plan to mostly focus on coding practices/tips I find myself learning overtime.
    Like how python pip requires a virtual environment, so installing it on the hardware is just a waste ngl.

    Just found out that we need to keep this journal up every week. I want to smash my brains out of pure agony. I just missed like 2 months of entries, I'm super screwed. We talk about this once, and forget it. Like. Dude. I wanna cry dude. Like I wanna piss all over assignments and burn them in a dumpster. So many god damn projects I need to trackkkkkkkkk. I just added a weekly assignment to canvas, cause yeah. I aint remembering to open VSCODE for anything EXCEPT CANVAS. NOT ESPECIALLY A JOURNAL IN .MD (I USE OBSIDIAN FOR MY MD FILES)

    I got my midterm today. I didn't study for it last night, so I only have the hour before class to study. It scares me a bit, just because I REALLY want a good grade. I don't think I'll get one, but I need to study very hard before the class anyways. I was doing the homework last night, and it was extremely maddening how fast the questions devolved into uncomprehensible answers that use techniques that are impossible to understand.

    Missed a week ugggghhh. I had the most horrible two shifts ever this weekend, but now im past it, so I shouldn't worry bout it. I need money. I'm mostly caught up now, just need to work on my web design class projects, which are like 1-2 weeks overdue now. shoot. If I do a journal sunday can that count for this week instead of this one?

    Told you I'd be back. I feel a lot better about myself now. I know that the outlook is really bleak, but now that I have money issues off my back, I'm ready to face school head on. I've been putting off assignments wayy too much this semester, and this past week I've started doing at least *part* of an assignment every day. At least a substantial chunk. With work, I really can't rely on smooth coasting with last minute work, and a lot of assignments I need to track myself. So time to pull my bootstraps or something.

    Happy Halloween I guess. I dressed as a clown this year, it was alright. I gotta work on a math project today, if I don't do it my grade is probably a definite F for the semester. I gotta work more on my team project this week, I've barely touched the repo. I got a new watch after my birthday last month, but I regret it now. I could've spent those dollars on food and tuiton. I don't need another watch.

    I know it's been like 3 days since the last one, but it's a new week or something. My grades still suck. I got that math project turned in sunday, but the teacher made it due at 11pm instead of 12am. So as soon as I got back from work I had only an hour and a half to get it done. If I had 10 more minutes I could have finished it. It's alright where it stands right now I suppose. I want to work on password hashing for the database for the youface project this week (if I have the time). No one seems to care about it, but It's definitely way more feasible that DIRECT MESSAGING (why did we add this issue bruh).

## 11/13/2025
    It's been a whole week since the last entry. I've been feeling great about myself recently, but there's still the burden of my previous mistakes. I'm doing good in my classes, but since I messed up the mid-terms so horribly I need *perfection* in order to achieve my goals of all A's and B's. Combined with increase work hours, I feel like I'm going all gas, no brakes. I'm getting used to it though, it was a lot harder 2 weeks ago, but now I can sit down and do homework with no issue.
    I should say something about the youface project too. I don't think my team is creating a good product. Our vision is so disjointed and fuzzy, we barely communicate about what we want. That's not something we can fix this late into the process, but it's definitely annoying. I didn't know it was going to be a "trolling" platform until we presented it. I'll try to do my best to flesh out the basic/security features so that the product works when we present it.
