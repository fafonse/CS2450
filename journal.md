    Today marks the start of this journal. I plan to mostly focus on coding practices/tips I find myself learning overtime.
    Like how python pip requires a virtual environment, so installing it on the hardware is just a waste ngl.

    Just found out that we need to keep this journal up every week. I want to smash my brains out of pure agony. I just missed like 2 months of entries, I'm super screwed. We talk about this once, and forget it. Like. Dude. I wanna cry dude. Like I wanna piss all over assignments and burn them in a dumpster. So many god damn projects I need to trackkkkkkkkk. I just added a weekly assignment to canvas, cause yeah. I aint remembering to open VSCODE for anything EXCEPT CANVAS. NOT ESPECIALLY A JOURNAL IN .MD (I USE OBSIDIAN FOR MY MD FILES)
